[03:57:38] Frozen Despair: 20 Jan?
[03:57:46] Frozen Despair: is that reasonable?

[03:58:20] Frozen Despair: also use snowflake over skar
[03:59:21] Frozen Despair: But once you've done the code you can probably give it to psycho so he can embed it into skar so we will have a bit if one of you can't leave the comp running
[03:59:57] Frozen Despair: when you see these messages copy paste/screenshot everything I've said and show to psycho when possible
